# Private Causal Neural Networks (PCNNs).
In this repository, we open-source the two private targeting strategies from our paper (in Python and R). This library allows you to estimate targeting policies while preserving the privacy of your subjects in a meaningful way (with differential privacy).

## Shiny app
I have created a Shiny app that allows you to upload CATE estimates and protect your targeting selection: https://gilianponte.shinyapps.io/private_targeting/

## Example using simulated data.
