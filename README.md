# Private Targeting Strategies.
This repository provides the implementation of two private targeting strategies from our research paper, enabling the estimation of targeting policies while preserving the privacy of subjects using differential privacy techniques. The implementation is available in both Python and R.

## Shiny app
I have created a Shiny app that allows you to upload CATE estimates and protect your targeting selection: https://gilianponte.shinyapps.io/private_targeting/

## Example using simulated data.
